## FAQ (Frequently Asked, Yet Slightly Annoying, Questions)

### Does this really need to be a library? 
Oh, absolutely not. Why write repetitive, error-prone XML manually when you can have a neat, Pythonic interface do it for you? But hey, if you enjoy typing `<svg>` and `</svg>` by hand all day, be my guest.  

### Isn't this too simple?
Yes! That's the entire point. If you want to suffer through boilerplate just to draw a circle, go ahead and use an overcomplicated graphics library. Otherwise, enjoy the simplicity.  

### Why not just use an existing SVG library?  
Good question! You totally can. But if you like minimalism and don't want to install yet another dependency just to generate a few shapes, this is for you. Plus, writing your own tools is way more fun.  

### Can I use this to make complex SVG graphics?  
Sure! You just have to put in some effort. ~~If you're expecting AI-powered, automatic art generation, you're in the wrong place. This is a lightweight interface, not a magic wand.~~ If you do feed this and the examples into an AI coding engine then you can get some working outputs fast. 

### How do I install this? 
You don’t. It’s literally one Python file. Copy it, use it, and move on with your life.  

### Why does this use function calls to nest elements?
Because it the simpleist way to do nesting.  

### Does this support animations?
Technically, yes. SVG supports animations so in theory this does too. But if you're asking this question, you're probably better off using JavaScript.  

### Can I contribute?
Of course! If you have an idea for improvement, open a pull request. If you just want to complain, feel free to scream into the void.
